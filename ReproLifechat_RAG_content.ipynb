In addition to this CMU Africa graduate student handbook, the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community expectations.\\n• The Word: Student Handbook\\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/\\n• University Policies\\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/\\n• Academic Integrity Policy\\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html\\n• Graduate Policies\\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html\\n• College of Engineering Graduate Degree Policies\\nhttps://engineering.cmu.edu/education/academic-policies/graduate-policies/degrees.html\\nStatement of Assurance Policy\\nCarnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does\\n8\\nnot discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws or executive orders.\\nFor more information about the Statement of Assurance and inquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX at institutionalequity@cmu.edu, and/or (412) 268-7125, or by mail Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.\\nCarnegie Mellon Code\\nThe Carnegie Mellon Code is accessible in The Word. Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical, and moral conduct possible. These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.\\nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.\\nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect the Carnegie Mellon degree holds. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.\\nCommunity Standards Overview The Community Standards Overview is accessible in The Word. Carnegie Mellon University is committed to cultivating an environment that supports the personal and intellectual growth of each student by promoting our traditions of innovation, leadership, responsibility to society, learning, dedication, commitment to quality and commitment to each other. We are a community with high expectations for those who choose to become members, including established community standards intended to foster behavior that is consistent with an educational setting where each member can achieve their full potential.\\nOffice of Institutional Equity and Title IX The Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX is dedicated to promoting equity at Carnegie Mellon University, which includes coordinating the University's efforts to prevent and effectively respond to all forms of gender discrimination (including gender identity discrimination) and sexual misconduct impacting community members, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking.\\nTo obtain guidance on how to file a report or a complaint of sex discrimination, of sexual harassment, and how the university responds to such reports refer to the Resource Guide.\\n9\\nThe Title IX Coordinator can be contacted at tix@cmu.edu, and/or (412) 268-7125, or by mail Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.\\nCampus Security and Fire Safety Report\\nCarnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report describing the university's security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault, and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. To obtain a copy of the annual security and fire safety report visit the Carnegie Mellon University Police Department website.\\nVisit the Carnegie Mellon University Africa website for general information and send email inquiries to africa-info@andrew.cmu.edu.\\nSTAFF AND FACULTY DIRECTORY\\nThe Carnegie Mellon University Africa faculty and staff are available to guide and provide you with support to complete your graduate degree program.

In addition, hard-copy books can be borrowed from the Academic Affairs Coordinator.\\nHealth Insurance\\nAll CMU-Africa students are eligible to join the CMU-Africa medical insurance plan. To subscribe, students should fill a health insurance form provided during Orientation. The policy runs on an annual renewable basis from September 1,2023 through August 31, 2024. CMU-Africa students who travel to Pittsburgh for a Semester exchange program are required to subscribe to the medical insurance plan and fulfill the immunization requirement. The Pittsburgh immunization guide can be found here.\\nSecurity\\nAll students, faculty and staff will be registered for the CMU-Africa Alert Emergency Notification Service, which sends text messages and emails to registered phones and email accounts in the event of a campus emergency. Registrants will be contacted by the CMU Alert system only if there is a campus emergency. Questions regarding the CMU Alert service should be sent via email to IT Ticket.\\n13\\nAndrew User ID and Password\\nAn official Andrew User ID is assigned to you upon enrollment and is required to access the Carnegie Mellon Web Portal, email, student account and other computing services. You will set up your confidential password upon your initial access. If you need help with your Andrew User ID and password contact Help Center africa-it-help@andrew.cmu.edu.\\nEmail\\nAll enrolled students are given a G Suite account that will allow email through Web Login and your Andrew ID and password is required for access.\\nComputing Services\\nComputing Services carries the responsibility for the vision, policy making, planning, development, implementation and overall administration for computing, library, and related technologies in support of teaching, research, and administrative activities at Carnegie Mellon University. Major features of that responsibility are coordinated with other institutional leaders, both academic and administrative to ensure that the University’s vision is realized.\\nStudent Laptop Policy\\nEach new CMU-Africa student is given the option of accepting a laptop provided by CMU-Africa at the start of their CMU-Africa degree program. The provided laptop is to be strictly for use during their studies at CMU-Africa. If they accept the laptop, upon completion of their degree program at CMU-Africa, they are required to either return it in good working condition (as assessed by CMU-Africa IT team) or purchase it at 25% of the original cost of the laptop.\\nGiven their educational purpose for CMU-Africa students, these laptops should not be transferred to anyone else or kept unused by the student. It is acceptable not to take the laptop if a student has a personal laptop that meets or exceeds the CMU-Africa laptop specifications. The CMU-Africa laptops come with a 2-year warranty that covers manufacturing defects but does not cover accidents or negligence. As such, students will be responsible for laptop problems caused by accidents or negligence.\\nIn case a student’s CMU-Africa provided laptop needs repair, the student will be responsible for taking it to the vendor. The vendor will determine whether the warranty covers the repair or not. Students will then be responsible for paying the cost of repair if the damage is not covered under the warranty.\\nCMU-Africa will aid in the following ways:\\n14\\n● Transportation of the damaged laptop to and from the vendor. The student will have to be present when the laptop is taken to the vendor. To avoid the student’s classroom attendance inconvenience, a CMU-Africa driver may pick the laptop from the vendor on behalf of the student where payment is not a requirement.\\n● A loaner laptop is available for a maximum of two weeks while their primary laptop (CMU-provided or personal) is being repaired or replaced. The request of a loaner laptop should be submitted to IT Ticket and cc the Student Affairs Team for approval. Note that there are a limited number of loaner laptops available for students, and the loaner should be returned immediately the primary laptop repaired in a period that should not exceed two weeks.\\n● Two laptops will be available after working hours and during weekends. They can be requested for by sending an email to africa-it-help@andrew.cmu.edu\\n● The CMU-Africa Student Services Officer will handle cases where a student is unable to cover the cost of laptop repair.\\nStolen Laptop Policy\\nStudents are required to exercise care of the laptop issued to them to prevent loss in the period of their studies at CMU-Africa. Stolen laptops will not be replaced by CMU-Africa.\\nIn the event of a stolen laptop, the student owner is required to report the stolen laptop within 24 hours to the CMU-Africa IT Senior Manager and the Student Services Officer. The report should include a Police Incident Report/Case number. A surcharge of 25% of the cost of the laptop will be required to obtain clearance from the University at the end of the program for all stolen laptops including those that are not recovered.\\nFailure to report a missing laptop to the Police and CMU-Africa will result in the student having to pay the full cost of the laptop.\\nComputing Policy\\nThe purpose of this policy is to set forth guidelines so that members of our community may use the campus network and computing facilities in ways that are responsible and respectful of privacy. This policy sets forth the university’s expectations of acceptable behavior on the part of computer systems users at Carnegie Mellon by providing guidelines for appropriate use of computing and related communication systems and examples of inappropriate use. These standards of acceptable behavior also extend beyond the campus community into the Internet. Just as it is unacceptable to violate others’ rights to privacy, property and resources within Carnegie Mellon, it is also unacceptable to violate those rights on systems that are not at Carnegie Mellon but are accessible through Carnegie Mellon’s connection to the Internet.\\nThis policy applies to all users of Carnegie Mellon computing systems, including students, faculty and staff, and any others granted the use of university computing resources. It applies\\n15\\nto the use of all computing facilities owned, leased, operated or contracted by Carnegie Mellon University. As used in this policy, terms such as “computing,” “computing/communications systems,” “computing resources,” etc., refer to all computers, communication systems, and peripherals, software, telephones, and systems with similar functions, which are owned by Carnegie Mellon, or which utilize Carnegie Mellon infrastructure such as telephone lines or computer networks.\\nAlthough this policy does not attempt to deal specifically with legal issues, university members are responsible to act in compliance with the law, including any federal, state and local laws governing computer and telecommunications use, as well as all other applicable university policies.\\nPlease review the policy in its entirety and return the acknowledgement form to the Student Services Officer by the end of orientation.\\nComputing Best Practices\\nWe ask that students commit themselves to the following computing best practices:\\n1. Use a strong password or passphrase\\nReview the Guidelines for Password Management for the definition of a strong password and for recommended practices for safeguarding your password. Never write a password down or share it with anyone.\\n2. Never leave your computer unattended in public locations\\nWhile security cable locks may serve as a theft deterrent, many have been shown to be ineffective against a determined thief. If you need to leave your computer unattended in your car, place it in the trunk or in some location where it is not visible to a passerby.\\n3.

Academic deadline information can be found within The HUB’s Academic Calendar.\\nStudents who are not progressing toward degree completion and are concerned they are unable to fulfill the required prerequisites and courses for the master’s degree program should seek advice from their Faculty Advisor and guidance from the Academic Advisor.\\nDegree Requirements Timeframe\\nThe duration of CMU-Africa master’s degree programs are defined in the curriculum and each course or component is assigned a specific number of units.\\nThe total number of units of a course or component indicates the average number of hours a student should devote per week for the course or component in a full semester and this includes presence in class, course readings, assignments. To earn a master’s degree students must complete a specific number of units within the duration of a program below. Degree Program Units Semesters\\nMaster of Science Information Technology (MS IT)\\n144\\n3 to 4\\nMaster of Science Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (MS EAI)\\n144\\n3 to 4\\nMaster of Science Electrical and Computer Engineering (MS ECE)\\n97\\n2 to 3\\nMaster of Science Advance Study in Electrical and Computer Engineering (MS ECE)\\n133\\n3 to 4\\nFor full-time status students must enroll in at least 36 units each semester. To complete the degree program required prerequisites and courses students may need to enroll in more than 36 units. The maximum number of units allowed in a semester is 48 units.\\nStudents are responsible for completing their registration each semester via their SIO portal. Students who are not enrolled by the tenth day of class will be withdrawn from the university.\\nThe typical graduate course is 12 units (i.e., 12 hours per week). There are full-semester courses that are 6 units. CMU also offers half-semester classes called “minis”. The average number of hours per week devoted to a mini course should be twice the number of units assigned for that mini. The typical mini is 6 units (i.e., 12 hours per week for half a semester).\\n21\\nOnce a student has exceeded the minimum required number of credits for their degree program by 24 units they are ineligible to register for courses and must either graduate or leave the university. Students at the end of their last semester for master’s degree program that have not satisfied graduation requirements will need to petition the Director of CMU-Africa to extend to complete coursework. Refer to CMU-Africa Academics for more information about degree programs.\\nClass Attendance\\nIt is mandatory for students to be present and attend in-person and virtual classes at the start of the semester.

The letter grade scale is as follows: ‘A- ‘, ‘B+’, ‘B’, ‘B- ‘, ‘C+’, ‘C’, ‘C- ‘, ‘D+’, ‘D’, and ‘R’. CIT students will not receive an ‘A+’ grade on their transcript even if a course is taken at another college that posts ‘A+’ on the student’s transcript. Grades that are lower than a C- are considered a “No Pass” at CMU-Africa in the CIT and will not count toward fulfilling master’s degree requirements.\\nQuality Point Average\\nFor the Academic Advisor to certify students for graduation the student must have a Cumulative Quality Point Average (CQPA) of at least 3.0 or B in required courses earned for their master’s degree program. Coursework or graduate project units with a grade lower than ‘C’ will not be considered to fulfill course requirements for their master’s degree program. Courses with a grade lower than “C” are calculated into the student’s cumulative QPA.\\nAcademic Probation\\nFor students with a semester QPA below a 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. The Academic Advisor will officially inform the student of their academic probation by letter. During the academic probation period it is mandatory for the student to meet with the Academic Advisor and adhere to recommendations to improve the subsequent semester.\\nOnce a student’s semester QPA is above 3.0 he/she is automatically removed from academic probation. If a student has a semester QPA lower than 3.0 at the end of two consecutive full semesters he/she may be permanently dismissed from the master’s program at the discretion of the Director of CMU-Africa. Students in this circumstance will have an opportunity to appeal the dismissal and should refer to the Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures for guidance.\\nACADEMIC INTEGRITY\\nAcademic Integrity\\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon are engaged in preparation for professional activity of the highest standards. Each profession constrains its members with both ethical responsibilities and disciplinary limits. To assure the validity of the learning experience a university establishes clear standards for student work.\\nIn any presentation, creative, artistic, or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.\\n26\\nCMU-Africa adheres to the Carnegie Mellon University Academic Integrity Policy and all students are expected to review the policies prior to their arrival at CMU-Africa. The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.\\nIn addition, instructors are responsible for defining academic integrity for students in their courses, including student performance expectations and attendance requirements. Students are responsible for understanding and abiding by the instructor’s academic integrity policies. Policies may vary from instructor to instructor and students should seek further guidance from a faculty member if they have specific questions about a course’s academic integrity policy.\\nDefinition of Cheating and Plagiarism\\nCheating includes but is not necessarily limited to:\\n● Plagiarism, explained below.\\n● Submission of work that is not the student's own for papers, assignments, or exams.\\n● Submission or use of falsified data.\\n● Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam.\\n● Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.\\n● Use of unauthorized material including textbooks, notes, or computer programs in the preparation of an assignment or during an examination.\\n● Supplying or communicating in any way unauthorized information to another student for the preparation of an assignment or during an examination. Note that giving unauthorized assistance is considered cheating even if no specific student who benefits from the assistance is identified.\\n● Collaboration in the preparation of an assignment. Unless specifically permitted or required by the instructor, collaboration will usually be viewed by the university as cheating. Each student, therefore, is responsible for understanding the policies of the department offering any course as they refer to the amount of help and collaboration permitted in preparation of assignments.\\n● Submission of the same work for credit in two courses without obtaining the permission of the instructors beforehand.\\nPlagiarism includes, but is not limited to, failure to indicate the source with quotation marks or footnotes where appropriate if any of the following are reproduced in the work submitted by a student:\\n● A phrase, written or musical\\n● A graphic element\\n● A proof\\n● An idea derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person\\n27\\nAcademic Integrity Procedures\\nFor detailed information on Academic Policies and Academic Disciplinary Actions students should refer to The Word: Student Handbook. Students should refer to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity to obtain information and resources for student conduct.\\nIn accordance with CMU policy a student who violates the academic integrity policy will not be permitted to drop the course in which the offense occurred to avoid a penalty. If the student attempts to drop the course, they will be reenrolled.\\nA student with multiple academic integrity violations may result in dismissal from the master’s degree program. Students have the right to appeal an academic integrity decision.\\nDisciplinary Probation\\nStudents who commit an academic integrity violation are placed on disciplinary probation within the department for the remainder of their academic program. While on disciplinary probation, students are allowed to continue with the program and are required to meet with the Academic Advisor.\\nAcademic Disciplinary Actions\\nThe procedures and penalties described in the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions are applied when there are academic integrity violations by graduate students. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity.

Under extraordinary circumstances, the internship requirement may be waived with permission from the CMU-Africa Director. The purpose of the internship is for students to work as short-term employees at an organization to gain technical and professional experience. Students are immersed in a business environment and given an opportunity to perform real IT and engineering work for the host organization. Students must be employed under contract by the organization during their internship. The expectation for the organization that offers the internship will compensate students with stipend that is paid monthly. The expectation for students is to deliver the results as defined in the temporary employment contract.\\nMaster's Practicum Project for Professional Track\\nThe Practicum provides an opportunity to consolidate and apply the skills and knowledge developed in previous coursework in a team-based effort to solve a real problem. A team of students works with a client on a real-world problem of value to the client. Most importantly, this is an opportunity to apply the team's advanced engineering and management skills, including the specialized knowledge and skills needed to solve a real problem. Team members must learn to work effectively with clients, quickly understand their problem, negotiate deliverables and then select, adapt and apply the right amount of process and documentation to meet clients' needs and effectively manage the project.\\nMaster’s Entrepreneurship Project for Entrepreneurship Track\\nThe Entrepreneurship Project is an opportunity for students to build and practice skills in developing information technology ideas that create value for a selected set of customers. Students work in small teams on a concrete project to bridge the gap between entrepreneurial theory and practice. This project combines both independent team study and working with technical and professional mentors to apply concepts in the creation of a new information technology venture. Only a small number of students are expected to be allowed into the entrepreneurship project track, based on a selective process that assesses the entrepreneurship project that the student team proposes.\\nMaster’s Research Project for Research Track\\nThe Research Project is conducted under the supervision of a faculty research adviser who first approves the proposed research project based on the student’s skills and mutual research interests. The research adviser and the student define and approve a study plan appropriate for the research. The research project will lead to a presentation and defense of a thesis in front of a committee and may lead to the submission of a scholarly paper.\\nEngineering Independent Study\\nWith the approval and supervision of a faculty member students perform an Independent Study that focuses on a topic that is pertinent to their interest of study.
