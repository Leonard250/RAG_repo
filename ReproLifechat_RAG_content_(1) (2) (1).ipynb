            "\n",
            "When a baby girl is born, her ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of eggs, which remain inactive until puberty begins. At puberty, the pituitary gland (in the central part of the brain) starts making hormones that stimulate the ovaries to make female sex hormones, including estrogen. The secretion of these hormones causes a girl to develop into a sexually mature woman.\n",

            "Toward the end of puberty, girls begin to release eggs as part of a monthly period called the menstrual cycle. About once a month, during ovulation, an ovary sends a tiny egg into one of the fallopian tubes.\n",

            "It can take up to 2 years from menarche for a girl's body to develop a regular menstrual cycle. During that time, her body is adjusting to the hormones puberty brings. On average, the monthly cycle for an adult woman is 28 days, but the range is from 23 to 35 days.\n",

            "What Happens If an Egg Is Fertilized?\n",
            "If a female and male have sex within several days of the female's ovulation, fertilization can happen. When the male ejaculates (when semen leaves the penis), a small amount of semen is deposited into the vagina. Millions of sperm are in this small amount of semen, and they \"swim\" up from the vagina through the cervix and uterus to meet the egg in the fallopian tube. It takes only one sperm to fertilize the egg.\n",
            "\n",
            "About 5 to 6 days after the sperm fertilizes the egg, the fertilized egg (pronounced: zygote) has become a multicelled blastocyst. A blastocyst (pronounced: BLAS-tuh-sist) is about the size of a pinhead, and it's a hollow ball of cells with fluid inside. The blastocyst burrows itself into the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium. The hormone estrogen causes the endometrium (pronounced: en-doh-MEE-tree-um) to become thick and rich with blood. Progesterone, another hormone released by the ovaries, keeps the endometrium thick with blood so that the blastocyst can attach to the uterus and absorb nutrients from it. This process is called implantation.\n",
            "\n",
            "As cells from the blastocyst take in nourishment, another stage of development begins. In the embryonic stage, the inner cells form a flattened circular shape called the embryonic disk, which will develop into a baby. The outer cells become thin membranes that form around the baby. The cells multiply thousands of times and move to new positions to eventually become the embryo (pronounced: EM-bree-oh).\n",
            "\n",
            "After about 8 weeks, the embryo is about the size of a raspberry, but almost all of its parts — the brain and nerves, the heart and blood, the stomach and intestines, and the muscles and skin — have formed.\n",
            "\n",
            "During the fetal stage, which lasts from 9 weeks after fertilization to birth, development continues as cells multiply, move, and change. The fetus (pronounced: FEE-tis) floats in amniotic (pronounced: am-nee-AH-tik) fluid inside the amniotic sac. The fetus gets oxygen and nourishment from the mother's blood via the placenta (pronounced: pluh-SEN-tuh). This disk-like structure sticks to the inner lining of the uterus and connects to the fetus via the umbilical (pronounced: um-BIL-ih-kul) cord. The amniotic fluid and membrane cushion the fetus against bumps and jolts to the mother's body.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pregnancy lasts an average of 280 days — about 9 months. When the baby is ready for birth, its head presses on the cervix, which begins to relax and widen to get ready for the baby to pass into and through the vagina. Mucus has formed a plug in the cervix, which now loosesn. It and amniotic fluid come out through the vagina when the mother's water breaks.\n",
            "\n",
            "When the contractions of labor begin, the walls of the uterus contract as they are stimulated by the pituitary hormone oxytocin (pronounced: ahk-see-TOE-sin). The contractions cause the cervix to widen and begin to open. After several hours of this widening, the cervix is dilated (opened) enough for the baby to come through. The baby is pushed out of the uterus, through the cervix, and along the birth canal. The baby's head usually comes first. The umbilical cord comes out with the baby. It's clamped and cut close to the navel after the baby is delivered.\n",
            "\n",
            "The last stage of the birth process involves the delivery of the placenta, which at that point is called the afterbirth. After it has separated from the inner lining of the uterus, contractions of the uterus push it out, along with its membranes and fluids.\n",

            "About 2 weeks before a girl gets her period, the egg is released from the ovary (this is called ovulation). The egg travels through the fallopian tube into the uterus. If the egg isn't fertilized by sperm, it starts to fall apart. Then the lining and egg leave a girl's body as her period and the whole thing starts all over again — that's why we use the word \"cycle.\" The first day a girl's period comes is Day 1 of her cycle.\n",

Illness, rapid weight change, or stress can also make things more unpredictable. That's because the part of the brain that regulates periods is influenced by events like these. Going on a trip or having a major change in schedule can also make your period come at a different time than expected. All of this is perfectly normal.\n",

            "It's also normal for the number of days a girl has her period to vary. Sometimes a girl may bleed for 2 days, sometimes it may last a week.

Even when the doctor or your parents reassure you that things will be OK, it's hard to wait for something that can affect how you feel about yourself.\n",

            "As you've probably noticed, puberty comes with all kinds of changes — including the way your body looks and even the way you might think it smells. These changes are a normal part of becoming a woman, but lots of girls worry about them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Do I Smell — and Can People Tell?\n",
            "Many girls wonder if they smell \"down there\" or if people notice when they have their periods. Some girls wonder if they should use douches, wipes, or any of the other products that claim to make women feel cleaner and fresher. But do these work? And does a girl really need them?\n",
            "\n",
            "The truth is that when everything's normal, no one else smells any odors from a girl's vagina. If a girl has an infection like bacterial vaginosis, she may notice a fishy smell. But even then, it's unlikely that people around her will notice it. Girls who notice an unusual smell should see a doctor just in case they have an infection.\n",

            "Should I Use Douches, Wipes, or Feminine Sprays?\n",
            "No. Douches, feminine sprays, deodorants, and wipes that are meant to keep a woman's vaginal area smelling fresh and clean can do more harm than good. Douching means washing out the vagina, usually with a product you buy in a store. But it's not a good idea to douche (unless a doctor tells you to). Douching can cause allergic reactions, irritation, and even infections.\n",
            "\n",
            "Feminine sprays, deodorants, and scented tampons aren't a good idea either. As with douching, they can lead to things like allergic reactions and irritation. Your vagina has its own natural cleaning system that flushes out bacteria, so you don't need to add any chemicals to help it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Smells caused by infections need to be treated with prescription medicines. Perfumed sprays don't make infections go away, they just cover up the smell for a short time. If you notice a bad smell or think you may have an infection, see a doctor or go to a health clinic right away.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's easy to keep your vagina clean without making it smell like a flower shop. You just need to shower or wash every day with a mild soap and plenty of warm water. Some girls like to take warm baths during their periods to help relieve cramps.\n",

            "What Else Can Help Me Feel Fresh?\n",

            "It may look like a lot of blood, but a girl usually only loses a few tablespoons of blood during the whole period. Most girls need to change their pad, tampon, or menstrual cup about 3‒6 times a day.\n",

            "There isn't one right age for a girl to get her period. But signs to watch for include:\n",
            "\n",
            "breasts starting to develop (periods usually start about 2 years after this)\n",
            "hair growing under a girl's arms and in her private parts\n",
            "seeing or feeling vaginal discharge fluid (sort of like mucus), which usually begins about 6 months to a year before a girl gets her first period\n",
            "What Causes a Period?\n",
            "A period happens because of changes in hormones in the body. Hormones are chemical messengers. The ovaries release the female hormones estrogen and progesterone , which cause the lining of the uterus (or womb) to build up. The built-up lining is ready for a fertilized egg (an egg that has joined with a sperm) to attach to and develop into a baby. If there is no fertilized egg, the lining breaks down and bleeds. Then the same process happens all over again.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "It usually takes about a month for the lining to build up, then break down. That is why most females get their periods around once a month.\n",
            "\n",
            "How Does Ovulation Relate to Periods?\n",
            "Ovulation (pronounced: ov-yoo-LAY-shun) is the release of an egg from the ovaries. The same hormones that cause the uterus lining to build up also cause an egg to leave one of the ovaries. The egg travels through a thin tube called a fallopian tube to the uterus.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the egg is fertilized by a sperm cell, it attaches to the wall of the uterus, where over time it develops into a baby. If the egg is not fertilized, the uterus lining breaks down and bleeds, causing a period.\n",
            "\n",
            "Do Periods Happen Regularly When Menstruation Starts?\n",
            "For the first few years after a girl starts her period, it might not come regularly. This is normal at first. By about 2–3 years after her first period, a girl's periods should be coming around once every 4–5 weeks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Can a Girl Get Pregnant as Soon as Her Period Starts?\n",
            "Yes, a girl can get pregnant as soon as her period starts. A girl can even get pregnant right before her very first period because her hormones might already be active. The hormones may have led to ovulation and the building of the uterine wall. If so and the girl has sex, she can get pregnant, even though she has never had a period.\n",
            "\n",
            "How Long Do Periods Last?\n",
            "Periods usually last about 5 days. But a period can be shorter or last longer.\n",
            "\n",
            "How Often Does a Period Happen?\n",
            "Periods usually happen about once every 4–5 weeks. But some girls get their periods a little less or more often.\n",
            "\n",
            "Should I Use a Pad, Tampon, or Menstrual Cup?\n",
            "You have many choices about how to deal with period blood. You may need to experiment a bit to find which works best for you. Some girls use only one method and others switch between different methods.\n",
            "\n",
            "Most girls use pads when they first get their period. Pads are made of cotton and come in lots of different sizes and shapes. They have sticky strips that attach to the underwear.\n",
            "Many girls find tampons more convenient than pads, especially when playing sports or swimming. A tampon is a cotton plug that you put into your vagina. Most tampons come with an applicator that guides the tampon into place. The tampon absorbs the blood. Don't leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours because this can increase your risk of a serious infection called toxic shock syndrome.\n",
            "Some girls prefer a menstrual cup. Most are made of silicone. To use a menstrual cup, a girl inserts it into her vagina. It holds the blood until she empties it.\n",

            "Some girls prefer a menstrual cup. Most are made of silicone. To use a menstrual cup, a girl inserts it into her vagina. It holds the blood until she empties it.\n",
            "How Much Blood Comes Out?\n",
            "It may look like a lot of blood, but a girl usually only loses a few tablespoons of blood during the whole period. Most girls need to change their pad, tampon, or menstrual cup about 3‒6 times a day.\n",
            "\n",
            "Will I Have Periods for the Rest of My Life?\n",
            "When women reach menopause (around age 45‒55), their periods will permanently stop. Periods also stop during pregnancy.\n",

            "What Is PMS?\n",
            "PMS (premenstrual syndrome) is when emotional and physical symptoms happen before or during a girl's period. These can include moodiness, sadness, anxiety, bloating, and acne. The symptoms go away after the first few days of a period.\n",
            "\n",
            "What Can I Do About Cramps?\n",
            "Many girls have cramps with their period, especially in the first few days. If cramps bother you, you can try:\n",
            "\n",
            "a warm heating pad on your belly\n",
            "taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or store brand) or naproxen (Aleve or store brand)\n",

            "have very heavy bleeding (bleeding that goes through a pad or tampon faster than every 1 hour)\n",
            "have periods that last more than about a week\n",
            "have severe PMS that gets in the way of your everyday activities\n",
            "What Else Should I Know?\n",
            "Periods are a natural, healthy part of life. They shouldn't get in the way of exercising, having fun, and enjoying life. If you have questions about periods, ask your doctor, a parent, health teacher, school nurse, or older sister.\n",

            "Usually, these changes begin between the ages of 8 and 14 for girls, and between 9 and 15 for guys. This wide range in age is normal, and it's why you may develop several years earlier (or later) than most of your friends.\n",
